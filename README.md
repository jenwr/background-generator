adding changes
using this project as a test center 
and a practice center


git clone    // make a copy of the repository on your local machine.
git add filename // stage files, these files are ready to be included in the project.
git commit -m "comment here"  // signify that the files are ready to ship. The coder commits to this version as ready to share. 
git push // the coder sends or pushes the committed files to the github repository.

Along the way monitor the changes with: 
git status

Start a new work session with: 
git pull // to obtain any updates made by team members.

Regarding branches...
Best practice means working on a branch rather than the authority files in master. 
git branch // indicates all existing branches. 
git branch newbranchname // creates a new branch by the name of newbranchname
git checkout newbranchname // reserves this branch space to this user only. 

See lecture 144 on git and github for more about conflicts.
